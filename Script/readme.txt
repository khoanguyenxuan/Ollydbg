1. About OllyScript
-------------------
OllyScript is a plugin for OllyDbg, which is, in my opinion, 
the best application-mode debugger out there. One of the best 
features of this debugger is the plugin architecture which allows 
users to extend its functionality. OllyScript is a plugin 
meant to let you automate OllyDbg by writing scripts in an 
assembly-like language. Many tasks involve a lot of repetitive 
work just to get to some point in the debugged application. By 
using my plugin you can write a script once and for all. 

------------------------------

2. Status (10 July 2004)
----------------------------
v0.92
A big bug in script synchronization fixed (thanks loveboom!).
GN behaviour updated.
MOV can now write strings to memory.

v0.91
A bug related to pausing the application fixed, the GN command added, ASM returns $RESULT.

v0.9
OllyScript has now been downloaded more then 10000 times! That means more then 2Gb of raw
scripting power flowing down the optic cable veins of the Internet. Not bad if you ask me!
The development of the plugin has been a bit slow, I've got a job programming xray systems
which has taken a lot of time. Sorry about that.

2.1 What's new?
---------------
+ New commands: ASK, BPL, BPLCND, COB, COE, EVAL, EXEC/ENDE, GN, TICND, TOCND
+ Execution of code in the target process context
+ String concateration with ADD or EVAL
+ Input box
+ Logging breakpoints
+ Removal of EOB and EOE
+ Tracing with condition
+ Get name of address
# ASM now returns assembled length in $RESULT
# Fixed pause crash bug
# Fixed bug with JBE, hopefully it was the last of the Jxx bugs
# OllyScript now REQUIRES OllyDbg v1.10. No other versions are officially supported.

------------------------------

3. Documentation
----------------
Two example scripts (tElock098.osc and UPX.osc) are available with this release. 
The scripts will when run immediately find the OEP packed executable. 

3.1 Language
------------
The scripting language of OllyScript is an assembly-like language.

In the document below, src and dest can be (unless stated otherwise):
 - Constant in the form of a hex number withot prefixes and suffixes (i.e. 00FF, not 0x00FF or 00FFh)
 - Variable previously declared by VAR
 - A 32-bit register (one of EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP, EIP). Non 32-bit registers are not supported at
   the moment, but you can use SHL/SHR and AND to get their values.
 - A memory reference in square brackets (i.e. [401000] points to the memory at address 401000, 
	[ecx] points to the memory at address ecx).
 - A flag with an exclamation mark in front (one of !CF, !PF, !AF, !ZF, !SF, !DF, !OF)
 - Sometimes byte strings are required. those are scripted as #6A0000# (values between two #) and 
	must have an even number of characters.
 - Some byte strings can contain the wildcard '?', for exampla #6A??00# or #6?0000#

FIND addr, what
---------------
Searches memory starting at addr for the specified value.
When found sets the reserved $RESULT variable. $RESULT == 0 if nothing found.
The search string can also use the wildcard "??" (see below).

Example:
	find eip, #6A00E8# // find a PUSH 0 followed by some kind of call
	find eip, #6A??E8# // find a PUSH 0 followed by some kind of call

FINDOP addr, what

Example:
	gn 401000

GPA proc, lib

Gets the address of the specified procedure in the specified library.
When found sets the reserved $RESULT variable. $RESULT == 0 if nothing found.
Useful for setting breakpoints on APIs.

GO addr
-------
Executes to specified address (like G in SoftIce)

------------------------------

4. Integration with other plugins
---------------------------------
You can call OllyScript from your plugin and make it execute a script.
Use something like the source code below:

HMODULE hMod = GetModuleHandle("OllyScript.dll");
if(hMod) // Check that the other plugin is present and loaded
{
	// Get address of exported function
	int (*pFunc)(char*) = (int (*)(char*)) GetProcAddress(hMod, "ExecuteScript");
	if(pFunc) // Check that the other plugin exports the correct function
		pFunc("myscript.txt"); // Execute exported function
}

------------------------------

5. Contact me
-------------
To contact me you can post your question in the forum or go on IRC 
and message SHaG on EFnet. You can also mail me to shag-at-apsvans-dot-com.

------------------------------

6. License and source code
--------------------------
Soon I'm going to armadildo this plugin and charge an awful lot of money
for it! :P Seriously, you are free to use this plugin and the source code however 
you see fit. However please name me in your documentation/about box and if 
the project you need my code for is on a larger scale please also notify 
me - I am curious.

Source code for this plugin is available on request only. Please send me
a mail if you need it!

------------------------------

7. Thanks!
----------
I'd like to thank all the wonderful people who reported bugs, wrote scripts, came
with improvement ideas etc. 
R@dier for the great dumping engine.
And of course Olly for developing this great debugger!
